Section 1: First lesson. 
"Okay, class please take out your math workbook and copy down the scheldule for your tests and exams this year." Ms Ng, my mathematics teacher instructed. Wearing a pair of bright red glasses, you could easily tell that she was a strict teacher. "Ok, please take out your notebook as we will be going through..." she droned on. She would constantly speak very quickly, briefly explaining each point before moving onto the next. She would also change between english and chinese very frequently, probably because she would be more comfortable. despite all this, no one really bothered, as we all understood her perfectly. She could spaeak as fast as she wanted to and we would still understand her. She could talk for as long as she wanted to, and we still would not fall asleep. She could switch between english and chinese at every word, and we would still get the point. The point is, Ms Ng, no matter how quirky, or how unorthodox, is still a very good teacher!!!
